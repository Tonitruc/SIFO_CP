<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter133.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter133.v". The design "lpm_counter133.v" is a 4 bit dynamically controlled up/down modulus 13 counter. </P>
